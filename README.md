##### Concept:
> You start your adventure while you grab your fancy crystal keys, and the transport you to the mystical time zone, where time doesn't exist! The not-time time zone, if you will. The path branches ahread of you, where will you go?
> A comedy browser choose your own adventure game. We try to make it funny and nice to look at, but we might fail a but. who knows! It's an adventure :)
> is it actually funny or are we just sleep depriveed? you find out!

##### Inspiration:
> An improv game that we played right as the hackathon startedto get the inspiration flowing. It worked!

##### Notes:
> We were originally going to do an aquatic themed platformer game (inspired by the name of the hackathon), but we quickly realised we were in WAAAAY in over our head, so we switched to something that's (hopefully) a bit more manageable, but just as fun
> Evem with this, we DEFINITELY did not finish, there's a lot of story branches that end in dead ends, and ideally the endings would all have a picture to give a little more humor and some context. We also tried to get a sound tp play in the background and whenever you press the linkm but we couldn't quite figure is out 
> I know for a fact there's a more efficient way to do what we have done, and it probably involves JavaScript. Some of us do know JS (i swear), but we were having trouble connectibg everything
