##### Our Work:

##### Concept:
> A browser choose your own adventure game. We try to make it funny and nice to look at, but we might fail a but. who knows! It's an adventure :)

##### Inspiration:
> An imporv game that we played to get the inspiration flowing. It worked!

##### Notes:
> We were originally going to do an aquatic themed platformer game (inspired by the name of the hackathon), but we quickly realised we were in WAAAAY in over our head, so we switched to something that's (hopefully) a bit more manageable, but just as fun
