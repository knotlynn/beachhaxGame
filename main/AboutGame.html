    <h1>About the Game</h1>
  </header>

    <p>Our biggest inspipiration involved improvising, building a story and turning it into a game. Making sure our creativity shined
    through!</p>
    <p>(Name of Game) consist of making the right choices, as the story progresses you will get to decide your characters fate in hopes
    that they can one day achieve their end goal, of course this wont be easy, you will face many challenges on the way.</p>
    <p>(Name of Game) was built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. We used Atom, GitHub, and many more platforms.</p>
    <p>Some of the biggest challenges we faced had to do with programming and making sure our game looked just as great visually.</p>
    <p>We are mostly proud of our team effort and the experience we gained this weekend, although it was our first time competing at a
    Hackato we all realized our biggest strengths and built a strong bond.</p>
    <p>After a lot of research and headaches we learned our passion for learning and innovating, we learned that there are many ways and
    platforms to create a game designs and knowledge is always the key.</p>
    <p>What comes next you may ask? We plan on building and strengthening our skills in programming and excitedly oin the next Hackaton.</p>
